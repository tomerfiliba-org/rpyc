"""
channel - an abstraction layer over streams that works with data frames
(rather than bytes) and supports compression.
Note: in order to avoid problems with all sorts of line-buffered transports,
we deliberately add \\n at the end of each frame.

note: unlike previous versions, this is no longer thread safe (thread-safety was
moved up to the Connection class)
