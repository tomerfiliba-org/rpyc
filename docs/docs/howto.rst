This page contains a collection of useful concepts and examples for developing with RPyC

Redirecting Standard Input/Output
---------------------------------
You can "rewire" ``stdin``, ``stdout`` and ``stderr`` between RPyC hosts. For example, 
if you want to "forward" the ``stdout`` of a remote process to your local ``tty``, 
you can use the following receipt::

    >>> import rpyc
    >>> c = rpyc.classic.connect("localhost")
    >>> c.execute("print 'hi there'")   # this will print on the host
    >>> import sys
    >>> c.modules.sys.stdout = sys.stdout
    >>> c.execute("print 'hi here'")   # now this will be redirected here
    hi here

Also note that if you are using classic mode RPyC, you can use the 
`context manager <http://www.python.org/doc/2.5.2/lib/typecontextmanager.html>`_
``rpyc.classic.redirected_stdio``::

    >>> c.execute("print 'hi there'")                   # printed on the server
    >>> 
    >>> with rpyc.classic.redirected_stdio(c):          
    ...     c.execute("print 'hi here'")                # printed on the client
    ... 
    hi here
    >>> c.execute("print 'hi there again'")             # printed on the server
    >>>

Debugging
---------
If you are using the classic mode, you will be glad to know that you can debug remote 
exceptions with ``pdb``:

    >>> c = rpyc.classic.connect("localhost")
    >>> c.modules["xml.dom.minidom"].parseString("<<invalid xml>/>")

Tunneling
---------
Many times, especially in testing environments, you have subnets, VLANs, VPNs, firewalls 
etc., which may prevent you from establishing a direct TCP connection between two 
machines, crossing network  in two different networks. This may be done for security reasons or to simulate 
the environment where your product will be running, but it also hinders your ability to 
conduct tests. However, with RPyC you can overcome this limitation very easily: 
simply use the remote machine's ``socket`` module!

Consider the following diagram:

.. figure:: _static/howto-tunneling.png
   :align: center

Machine ``A`` belongs to network ``A``, and it wants to connect to machine ``B``, which
belongs to network ``B``. Assuming there's a third machine, ``C`` that has access to both 
networks (for instance, it has multiple network cards or it belongs to multiple VLANs), 
you can use it as a transparent bridge between machines ``A`` and ``B`` very easily: simply
run an RPyC server on machine ``C``, to which machine ``A`` would connect, and use its
``socket`` module to connect to machine ``B``. It's really simple::

    # this runs on machine `A`
    import rpyc
    
    machine_c = rpyc.classic.connect("machine-c")
    sock = machine_c.modules.socket.socket()
    sock.connect(("machine-b", 12345))
    
    sock.send(...)
    sock.recv(...)

Monkey-Patching
---------------
If you have python modules that make use of the ``socket`` module (say, ``telnetlib`` 
or ``asyncore``), and you want them to be able to cross networks over such a bridge, 
you can use the recipe above to "inject" ``C``'s socket module into your third-party module,
like so::

    import rpyc
    import telnetlib
    
    machine_c = rpyc.classic.connect("machine-c")
    telnetlib.socket = rpyc.modules.socket

This is called `monkey-patching <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monkey_patch>`_, it's a very
handy technique which you can use in other places as well, to override functions, classes
and entire modules. For instance ::

    import mymodule
    import rpyc
    # ...
    mymodule.os = conn.modules.os
    mymodule.open = conn.builtins.open
    mymodule.Telnet = conn.modules.telnetlib.Telnet

That way, when ``mymodule`` makes use of supposedly local modules, these modules 
actually perform operations on the remote machine, transparently.
