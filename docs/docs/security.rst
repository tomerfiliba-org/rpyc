Security
========
Operating over a network always involve a certain security risk, and requires some awareness. 
RPyC is believed to be a secure protocol -- no incidents have been reported since version 3 was
released in 2008. Version 3 was a rewrite of the library, specifically targeting security and 
service-orientation. Unlike v2.6, RPyC no longer makes use of unsecure protocols like ``pickle``,
supports :data:`security-related configuration parameters <rpyc.core.protocol.DEFAULT_CONFIG>`, 
comes with strict defaults, and encourages the use of a capability-based security model. 
I daresay RPyC itself is secure.

However, if not used properly, RPyC is also the perfect back-door... The general recommendation
is not to use RPyC openly exposed over the Internet. It's wiser to use it only over secure local 
networks, where you trust your peers. This does not imply that there's anything wrong with the 
mechanism -- but the implementation details are sometimes too subtle to be sure of.
Of course you can use RPyC over a :ref:`secure connection <ssl>`, to mitigate these risks

RPyC works by exposing a root object, which in turn may expose other objects (and so on). For
instance, if you expose a module or an object that has a reference to the ``sys`` module, 
a user may be able to reach it. After reaching ``sys``, the user can traverse ``sys.modules`` and
gain access to all of the modules that the server imports. This of course depends on RPyC
being configured to allow attribute access (by default, this parameter is set to false). 
But if you enable ``allow_public_attrs``, such things are likely to slip under the radar 
(though it's possible to prevent this -- see below). 

Wrapping
--------
The recommended way to avoid over-exposing of objects is *wrapping*. For example, if your object
has the attributes ``foo``, ``bar``, and ``spam``, and you wish to restrict access to ``foo`` and
``bar`` alone -- you can do ::

    class MyWrapper(object):
        def __init__(self, obj):
            self.foo = obj.foo
            self.bar = obj.bar

Since this is a common idiom, RPyC provides :func:`restricted <rpyc.utils.helpers.restricted>`. 
This function returns a "restricted view" of the given object, limiting access only to the 
explicitly given set of attributes. ::

    class MyService(rpyc.Service):
        def exposed_open(self, filename):
            f = open(filename, "r")
            return restricted(f, ["read", "close"], [])  # allow access only to 'read' and 'close' 

Assuming RPyC is configured to allow access only to safe attributes (the default), this would
be secure. 

When exposing modules, you can use the ``__all__`` list as your set of accessible attributes --
but do keep in mind that this list may be unsafe.

Classic Mode
------------
The classic mode (``SlaveService``) is **intentionally insecure** -- in this mode, the server
"gives up" on security and exposes everything to the client. This is especially useful for testing
environments where you basically want your client to have full control over the server. Only ever use
a classic mode server over secure local networks.

.. _config-params-security:

Configuration Parameters
------------------------
By default, RPyC is configured to allow very little attribute access. This is useful when your 
clients are untrusted, but this may be a little too restrictive. If you get "strange" 
``AttributeError`` exceptions, stating that access to certain attributes is denied -- you may
need to tweak the configuration parameters. Normally, users tend to enable ``allow_public_attrs``,
but, as stated above, this may have undesired implications.

Attribute Access
----------------
RPyC has a rather elaborate attribute access scheme, which is controlled by configuration
parameters. However, in case you need more fine-grained control, or wish to completely override
the configuration for some type of objects -- you can implement the **RPyC attribute protocol**.
This protocol consists of ``_rpyc_getattr``, ``_rpyc_setattr``, and ``_rpyc_delattr``, which
are parallel to ``__getattr__`` / ``__setattr__`` / ``__delattr__``. Their signatures are ::

    _rpyc_getattr(self, name)
    _rpyc_delattr(self, name)
    _rpyc_setattr(self, name, value)

Any object that implements this protocol (or part of it) will override the default attribute 
access policy. For example, if you generally wish to disallow access to protected attributes,
but have to expose a certain protected attribute of some object, just define ``_rpyc_getattr``
for that object which allows it::

    class MyObjectThatExposesProtectedAttrs(object):
        def __init__(self):
            self._secret = 18
        def _rpyc_getattr(self, name):
            if name.startswith("__"):
                # disallow special and private attributes
                raise AttributeError("cannot accept private/special names")
            # allow all other attributes
            return getattr(self, name)
