About RPyC
==========
RPyC was inspired by the work of **Eyal Lotem** on 
`pyinvoke <http://pybuild.sourceforge.net/pyinvoke.html>`_, which pioneered in 
the field of "dynamic RPC" (where there's no predefined contract between the 
two sides). The two projects, however, are completely unrelated in any other 
way. RPyC is developed and maintained by `Tomer Filiba <http://tomerfiliba.com>`_
(tomerfiliba@gmail.com).

   Please do not send questions directly to my email -- use our
   `mailing list <https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/rpyc>`_ instead.

designer :), and all the files are made available here:
